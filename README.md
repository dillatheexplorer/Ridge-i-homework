#practice
This repository are cosisted my explanation, program, and approach to find the best model.
Finally, I chose to train 50% all dataset training data to make dataset become balance rather than use different size of dataset.
I also would like to report that by using tf.concat function makes the performance slow.
CNN has been become the approaches in this report.
I build this architecture by using Lenovo Yoga 710, Inter core i5, windows 10 and 64 bit Ram 8GB.
Environment that has been used to establish the architecture is Anaconda Jupyternotebook tensorflow library and keras.
